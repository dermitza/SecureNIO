/**
 * An abstract, extensible implementation of a variable length packet worker.
 * This worker extends {@link AbstractPacketWorker} to support variable length
 * packets. <p> For the default implementation, packets should extend
 * {@link ch.dermitza.securenio.packet.PacketIF} and have a 3-byte header: 1
 * byte for packet designation and 2 bytes for message length. This results in
 * 255 packet types, with maximum packet length of 32,767 bytes if using java
 * shorts or 65,535 bytes if using an unsigned length implementation. NOTE:
 * packet length excludes the 3-byte header, i.e. is payload length. If more
 * packet types or a larger packet (payload) size is needed, use the argument
 * constructor. Note that the largest header size the constructor can take is 2
 * bytes, and the length variable can either be 2 or 4 bytes, representing java
 * shorts and ints respectively. <p>
 *
 * Application code should extend the singular method
 * {@link #assemblePacket(ch.dermitza.securenio.socket.SocketIF, short, byte[])}
 * to assemble the reconstructed packet and subsequently
 * {@link #fireListeners(SocketIF, ch.dermitza.securenio.packet.PacketIF)} with
 * the reconstructed packet.
